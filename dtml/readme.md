bio: A dynamic hardworking individual, a dreamer, a thinker, a planner, an explorer. Never an idle day! Over 8 years of industrial experience in Telecom - IT Management and opensource technologies, particularly Telecom/VoIP, Networks, IT Systems and Support, Systems Engineering and Servers Administration. In 13 years of my technology career, never ever I have come across an IT company that has such an exciting and thrilling mission and vision about the digital future of our planet. Most IT companies out there revolve around a few apps and their infrastructure, overall very limited in how they can innovate and make a difference to the technology globally. ThreeFold is the first company that I have seen in my 13 years that has a powerful idea that can potentially reshape our digital future. This is a movement, not a profitable business. I strongly believe that the idea of a responsible, secure and a decentralized INTERNET is going to take off soon and Threefold is going to be the pioneer of it.
