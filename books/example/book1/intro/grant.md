## Short Description

Data is the new gold. Data is generated everywhere but data storage is still very centralized. Most data lakes exist in one of the main cloud providers and while these data lakes grow in size they become increasingly more difficult to move around. In order for decentralisation to prosper data generated and used by DOA projects cannot end up being stored in one of these large cloud providers.

Integration between a layer 1 blockchain project and a decentralised data processing and storage technology will set the blockchain free of running in and storing data on these large cloud providers....

## Milestone 1 (100% done) = 100k USD

- Milestone title: 
    - Create the ability to run layer-1 blockchain nodes on the ThreeFold Technology grid. 
- Due date: done
- Details of what will be delivered:
    - The 1-click blockchain (Casper Labs and / or otherS) node deployment solution - powered by ThreeFold's P2P cloud, using Kubernetes and/or Docker. The ThreeFold grid has been up and running since 2018 and has a large quantity of compute and storage resources. The TF Grid is owned by independent farmers that believe in decentralized capacity generation everywhere. Over the last year, a number of blockchain projects have been looking for easy deployment options to allow their communities to have an alternative to "run a node on centralised clouds" to do it all yourself. We can offer a super exciting way here on top of our TFGrid.
- Acceptance Criteria:
    - All agreed layer 1 blockchain technologies have a "single click" deployment mechanism. All the current members of the ETA are considered to be candidates for grid deployments.

> remarks: we were an early grant and were trying to get feedback before submitting because there was no clarity for us how to do it and how sure we would be on the grant. We might have been not good enough in our communication, but the grant got removed before we could receive funding for the work done. We hope that this might be recovered, as such we have updated this document to reflect our current situation and work done.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- [X] provisioning solution can deploy blockchain nodes and this can be done by everyone
- [X] see how the provisioning method (1-click) cuts heavily on complexity
- [X] deploy a casper blockchain node in less than 5mins which would have taken hours before (software deployment)
- [X] all required code to allow everyone to experiment (see weblets repository [here](https://github.com/threefoldtech/grid_weblets))
- [X] all code is opensource (threefold as well as the deployers for provisioning)
- [X] do detailed research about casperlabs to see how integration can be done (and if): our conclusion it can be done (and is done)
- [X] link to required technology parts as provided by ThreeFold, see if we can use those solutions and what benefit would be
- [X] do all required work to let it work on ThreeFold Grid

## Milestone 2a  = 200k USD

Extend the TFGrid with capacity for all current layer-1 protocols involved in ETA, specifically for CasperLabs

- Milestone title:  Extend the TFGrid with capacity for all current layer-1 protocols involved in ETA (part a)
- The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 
    - USD 200.000 for part a
- Due date: 
    - Done
- Details of what will be delivered:
    - Extension of the TF Grid to have capacity for data processing and storage capabilities. Tested and verified hardware platforms are the Scaleout compute, Scaleout storage, and Titan V2. An architecture of how to combine these platforms into a scalable, secure, autonomous, distributed and decentralized platform needs to be created and this will also indicate the distribution and deployment plan. So the deliverable in this milestone is capacity in locations well connected and well powered, available to DevxDAO's done the DAO way. 
- Acceptance Criteria: Operational plaform and layer-1 protocols deployed on the 3nodes.

### Acceptance Criteria:

We have been able to leverage a lot of technology from Threefold Tech which has been developed over the last 10 years. This grant was all about making sure and improving this codebase so it can be used for CasperLabs. This is the result of hundreds of man-months for which we are delighted to receive recognition in a form of a grant.

- [X] support for casperlabs
- [X] support for pre-search
- [X] support for pokt.network (was a super big one and allows the next ones)
    - [X] ethereum
    - [X] harmony
    - [X] solana
    - [X] avalanche
    - [X] binance smartchain
    - [X] gnosis chain
    - [X] fuse blockchain
    - [X] polygon
- [X] weblets = the provisioning widgets
- [X] intelligent capacity planning
- [X] graphql layer to allow capacity planning (blockchain to graphql for all assets on blockchain)
- [X] availability of farming layer = 3node deployment  (today tens of nodes per day are added by community as proof)
- [X] documentation how to deploy nodes (hardware) and connect to Threefold network
- [X] documentation and make demonstration tutorials in text and video

## Milestone 2b  = 200k USD

> The work as specified here is additional in relation to the original grant.

- The portion that the OP is requesting from the total grant for the milestone: 
    - USD 200.000 for part B
- Due date: 
    - Nov 2022
- Details of what will be delivered:
    - Additional work which was not part of original but is good to do in line to where the market is today
    - Also work to make above more userfriendly and tangible by community to understand e.g. training material
  
> Change to this original milestone is that we will do a train the trainer program with CasperLabs or partners companies to make them self sufficient in taking the 1-click solution forward by themselves and even how to make changes in the deployment code and the widgets.

### Acceptance Criteria:

For this part of the grant we need much more input from Casperlabs.

- [ ] deploy private blockchain for casperlabs on X nr of nodes with consensus driven deployment (this resolves the blockchain dilemma problem)
- [ ] based on CasperLabs input create additional weblets of how to deploy any part of the casperlabs solution
- [ ] based on CasperLabs input create deployment scripts in vlang to make it super easy for community to deploy anything and make changes in the way how it gets deployed for their requirements
- [ ] based on CasperLabs input to where and for what partners private capacity is required, all required capacity has been deployed and is operational
- [ ] make a dedicated portal for casperlabs to bring all required knowledge, manuals and weblets together to allow the full community to experiment and deploy
- [ ] add dedicated nodes support (private nodes) 
- [ ] add deployment mechanism where blockchains can be deployed in 100% private mode, the deployers have no access to the data
- [ ] CasperLabs and Partner / Customer base has proven to be able to use the capacity and deploy blockchain nodes where required.
- [ ] Train the trainer program done
- [ ] better description of / manuals for the solution
- [ ] documentation and make demonstration tutorials in text and video
- [ ] document all links to code & scripts as used on above
