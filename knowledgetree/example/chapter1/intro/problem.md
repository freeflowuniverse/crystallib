# Problem statement

The current internet mainly consists of centralised datacenters and networks owned and operated by a handfull of service providers.  80% of the Internet belongs to less than 10 companies.  This is not helping blockchain layer-1 projects to achieve reliability and decentralization.

In this intenet blockchain node (owners) have two options:
- go to one of the market leader in cloud solution, get a VM and work their way through the install protocol for the blockchain node.
- get a (dedicated) server (hosting provider, colo or in a home or business setting) and use that bare metal, choose an OS and then follow the install protocol for the blockchain node.

Both require a fair amount of technical knowledge and require commitment and care throughout the timetime / cycle of the blockchain node operations.  


This current situation has two major drawbacks:

- relying on centralized hosting providers builds a very centralized blockchain node group deployment on those massive cloud providers.  Decentralization is not achieved and there is a fair amount of risk involved when issues occur in these datacenters.
- having to choose between cloud or bare metal and then following the installation protocol for the specific blockchain deployment requires a fair amount of technical skills.  This is not for everyone.
